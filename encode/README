This is an optimized version of the IIS reference mpeg layer 3 encoder.
The optimizations were made by Andreas Johansson.

The encoder reads wav files or raw PCM files and produces mpeg player 3
files. Right now joint-stereo or psychoachoustic model 1 are not
supported with layer 3. To encode the file audio.wav to a 128kbit/s mpeg
layer 3 file called audio.mp3, use this command line:

encode audio.wav audio.mp3

Use the software at your own risk.

CHANGES

Version 1.02a
-------------

- Added LICENCE file to enable Debian packaging of the encoder.
- Fixed in binary tables for layer II so it works again.

Version 1.02
------------

Note: Default raw data byte order has changed from little endian
----- to big endian with this version. This was supposed to be
      done in version 1.01, but never verified. Use option -L if
      you would like to encode little endian raw data files.

- Bugfix, too small malloc(), was in original iso code
- Bugfix, wav detection was totally corrupt!
- Bugfix, encoder was not working very well on big endian machines.
   Verified on solaris/sparc.
- Max filename size changed from 80 to 256 characters
- Option '-L' added, selects little endian raw PCM data, default
   being big endian data. Wav's are always little endian.
- Default bitrate is now 128kbit
- Filename "-" means use standard-in as instream instead of a file
- Removed some old crap in the archive
- Some cosmetic changes, e.g. progress meter
- Some speedups (~25% quicker) merged from Mike Cheng's LAMER encoder:
   o new fft
   o huffman encoding
   o filter subband optimizations (work by Stephane Tavenard)
   o sparse matrix for 44.1kHz in L3psychi_anal()
   o mdct
- Tables compiled into binary - tables directory not needed any more

Thanks to everyone you have contributed with patches and suggestions!

Version 1.01
------------

- Bugfix for digital unix, avioded malloc(0)
- Byteswapped raw mode is working again
- Changed defaults to layer III and psychoacoustic mode 2
- Removed my Makefile and configure cache
- Changed Makefile.in to compile with "better" optmization
